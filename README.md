# A Poker Practice App
## An app by John Meyer

This project is a react web app that helps you practice identifying your poker odds.
This is also my Seattle University WATS Course final for 2019.

The app calls the Deck of cards API to generate a set of cards:
API web site (https://deckofcardsapi.com/)
API github page (https://github.com/crobertsbmw/deckofcards)

Once the cards are generated the app compares all of the viewed cards to estimate the chance of making a poker hand.

Currently a work in progress...

If you would like to run your own version of the project:
1. Clone the repo
2. Install NPM
3. Install React with NPM
4. Run 'npm start' to start the Develpment server
5. Run 'npm build' to create a production build

This project uses the gh-pages library to deploy react to github

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.



### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
